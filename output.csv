I have a lot of board meetings and it is earnings season and I want to see how stocks react. The very high odds are for another rate hike this week as well.You can watch this weeks episode of Momentum Monday right here on YouTube. It is easy to subscribe and if you do every Sunday you will get an alert when we post the show to YouTube.https://lnkd.in/gfYqZAQcAt the end of show I spend some time explaining how Web 2.0 leaders are acting much stronger now and why this might last.Here are Ivanhoff’s thoughts:\""Bull markets correct through sector rotations. This is exactly what we have been seeing lately. While recent leaders have been pulling back to their 20 and 50-day moving averages, capital has been rotating into defensive sectors like healthcare, consumer staples, and utilities. I don’t know how long this rotation will last. It makes sense that many market participants are reducing risk ahead of the FOMC meeting on Wednesday and the earnings reports in the next few weeks.The latest earnings season is just getting started. So far, we had financials crushing estimates and rising for the most part. The three momentum stocks that reported earnings pulled back – Tesla, Netflix, and Intuitive Surgical. All of them beat the always conveniently-low earnings estimates. All of them had a significant rally ahead of their earnings which typically means that any good news was already priced in. This is one of the reasons we saw all three selling off. They are all in an uptrend on a daily and weekly time frame. It is normal to see them test their 50-day moving average after they broke below their 10 and 20-day moving averages.The semiconductor sector also had two strategically important companies report. ASML, which is the biggest producer of machines that make chips, and Taiwan Semiconductor, which is the biggest producer of the actual chips in the world. Both sold off slightly after their reports. TSM guided next year’s revenue down citing the cyclicality of their business. Their fastest-growing component is AI-related chips. They currently account for only 6% of their total revenue but are expected to grow at a 50% compound annual growth rate in the next 5 years and increase to low teens percent of revenue. So yes, demand for Ai chips is hot and it is expected to remain so in the next few years. I don’t know how much of that is already priced in but it also explains why every dip in NVDA and MSFT is getting bought and why every major company is working on A.I.\"" ""},{""link"":""https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7088305645946359808?updateEntityUrn=urn%3Ali%3Afs_updateV2%3A%28urn%3Ali%3Aactivity%3A7088305645946359808%2CFEED_DETAIL%2CEMPTY%2CDEFAULT%2Cfalse%29"",""content"":""About the only thing I can get better at in my later years is investing (Ellen would say my gas level is Tour De France next level shape).

Instead of a call (or text these days), they would simply step outside their homes, see their friends and neighbors hanging out, and join them in conversation. This would often lead to sharing food, drinks, and more social interaction. While the community they grew up in lacked economic opportunities, it was rich in social connections. I believe it's the opposite in many modern cities.I think the concept of '15-minute cities' for fostering friendships within our own communities is a strong one. However, the friends you grew up with, who are no longer close, are different from the friends you make in your new community. Yes, technology to connect exists, but it doesn't provide the same daily, casual, and serendipitous connections that you experience simply by walking outside.What If We Had a 15-Minute City for Friendship?

They connect you to something larger. One of my most important ambitions is to be a great father and friend. Another is to leave the world a better place than I found it. You can't have a meaningful life without a connection to something larger than yourself.Reality minus expectations = happiness. You will never be happy unless your expectations are exceeded. If you think the world owes you something, you're going to end up disappointed. The world doesn't owe you anything. You can't sit around waiting for the world to come and hand you what you think you deserve. If you want something to happen, you have to take action. Go positive and go first.High standards - When it gets hard, do not lower your standards. I am not always at my best, but I always give my best. I hold myself to a high bar.

Here’s how we’re bringing the energy back to remote video calls with Boom💥 http://getboom.app💥 (No, it’s not a new Zoom or Loom)Like many, I loved the flexibility we gained from embracing remote work. But the energy in meetings was lost. We called it “Zoom fatigue”, but it didn’t matter what video conferencing tool you used.The managers and crafters who thrived did things differently:⚡️They treated presentations and team-wide talks like live events.⚡️They engaged their co-workers in new ways.⚡️They approached video calls like streamers.They created energy and shaped a new work culture 🔋We’re not “video conferencing” anymore. Remote work has turned us into live streamers.Boom’s vision is to help more people embrace this reality by transforming your camera into a canvas to express yourself, connect more in meetings, and captivate audiences when you present, regardless of the video conferencing tool you use.Building a startup is really just an excuse to work with talented friends. The Boom team is made of some of my fave collaborators from Shopify—also known as the company that banned unnecessary meetings. We built Boom for ourselves based on that experience—to bring that Boom Energy to this new digital workplace and make it more memorable, productive, and fun.It's fun to debate remote vs. back-to-office, but that’s not our style. We think the best way to complain is to make things! So if you want to come along for the ride, join the waitlist and follow us on twitter @BoomVisionCo. 💥 www.getboom.app💥 hashtag #remotework hashtag #energy hashtag #startups hashtag #videoconferencing hashtag #boom ""}]}"

And I’m going to do it again.Fasting isn't about weight loss. It's about regeneration, healing, and self-discovery. In quieting my physical hunger, I unlocked mental clarity and spiritual revelation. A total reset. As an athlete, I was always told to eat big and stay strong. I never questioned it. But breaking away, and embracing fasting, changed everything. I'm not only lighter in weight; I'm lighter in spirit. Fasting isn’t for everyone, I get that. But for me, it was a life-changer. The benefits are profound. Clearer skin, better digestion, improved mental focus, and even my joint pain lessened. My journey hasn't been about shedding pounds; it's been about shedding old habits, and old ways of thinking. Fasting opened a door to a healthier, happier me. It gave me control back. Today, I stand before you - changed, empowered, and inspired. Whether you're considering fasting, or just looking to change your life, remember: The first day is always the hardest.

If you’ve tuned into anything over the years, you’ve heard my slogan: channels, channels, channels.As our oldest acquired founder today, my last tour of duty leading Product Acceleration (M&A / Ventures) let me bring many more founders closer to and inside of Shopify. I've had as much fun in these last few years as my first, which is what makes Shopify, Shopify. It wasn’t always easy, but it was always worth it.Shopify is a founder-led company built by founders for founders. Tobi embodies this founder’s mentality and has built a culture that identifies, empowers, and celebrates people who match this mindset. I’ve never second-guessed my identity as a founder despite being here over twice as long as I was one.In 2013, Shopify had a bigger vision for Jet Cooper than we had for ourselves, so we built Shopify Toronto… and the rest is history. I’m biased, but I really think we changed the course of tech in the city with what followed. Toronto is the greatest city in the world, and it’s time to build again.In 2023, I’m also a happy husband, (cool) dad, (bad) golfer, angel investor, board member, and forever work-in-progress. I’m excited to spend more time on all of those things, plus work on our family office with the one and only Arati (more to come on that soon).A heartfelt thanks to Tobias, Harley, Craig, Bram, Brandon, Anna, my amazing team, my fellow founders, the incredible alumni, and Shopifolk everywhere for a journey of a lifetime.I love Shopify, I’ll miss being a part of it, and I’ll always be rooting for us. 💚 ""},{""link"":""https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7086718977103577088?updateEntityUrn=urn%3Ali%3Afs_updateV2%3A%28urn%3Ali%3Aactivity%3A7086718977103577088%2CFEED_DETAIL%2CEMPTY%2CDEFAULT%2Cfalse%29"",""content"":""""},{""link"":""https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7080537971203981312?updateEntityUrn=urn%3Ali%3Afs_updateV2%3A%28urn%3Ali%3Aactivity%3A7080537971203981312%2CFEED_DETAIL%2CEMPTY%2CDEFAULT%2Cfalse%29"",""content"":""Introducing Shopify Ventures!
